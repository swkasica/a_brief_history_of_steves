# A Brief History of Steves

This repo contains [slides](https://github.com/swkasica/a_brief_history_of_steves/index.slides.html), data, and code for my talk for UBC Computer Science's Undistinguished Lectures Series (UDLS) on Feb. 8, 2019.

## Abstract
With so many Steves in the Trump Administration, the past couple years have been a rough time for the Steve community. It's time for someone to stand up for Steves. We Steves are your classmates, we're your professors, and Canadian atmospheric phenomena. We have a rich, proud history that shouldn't be obscured by a few bad Steves. We're not just a poor man's Greg; we're Steves!
